1. Install Python:
- Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Click on the "Downloads" tab.
- Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and
download it.
- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to check the box that says
"Add Python to PATH" during the installation process.
- Once the installation is complete, open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal
(macOS/Linux) and type python --version to verify that Python has been installed correctly. You
should see the version number of Python printed to the screen.
2. Download Jupyter Notebook:
- Go to the Jupyter Notebook website: https://jupyter.org/install
- In the Jupyter Notebook section, there is a command:
pip install notebook
- Run it on your command prompt and jupyter notebook will be installed.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook from Command Prompt/Terminal:
- Once you have installed Jupyter Notebook, open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal
(macOS/Linux).
- Type the following command and press Enter to start Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
- This will open a new tab in your web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface, allowing
you to create and run Python code cells.
With these steps, you should have both Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your
computer, and you'll be able to run Jupyter Notebook from the command prompt or terminal.
